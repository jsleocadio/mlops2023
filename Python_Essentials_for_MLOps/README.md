# Python Essentials for MLOps

## Introduction

Here, we will present some of the best practices for application development. They are:

* **Code Refactoring:** refactoring is not just a one-time activity but anongoing process. A well-refactored code is easier to understand,
debug, and maintain. We strongly encourage you to refactor your
code as you progress with your projects.
* **Clean Code Principles:** writing clean code is essential for the
long-term maintainability of your projects. Follow principles like DRY
(Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple) to make your code
more effective and easier to understand.
* **Linting:** a linting score of at least 9/10 is required for this assignment. Utilize tools like pylint to analyze your code and adhere to best practices.
* **Exception Handling:** proper exception handling can make your code
robust and easier to debug. Use Python’s **try, except, finally** blocks
to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
* **Logging:** include logging in your projects to capture runtime
information, which can be invaluable for debugging and monitoring
your code's behavior. Use Python’s built-in logging library to include
logs at various levels such as **INFO, DEBUG, ERROR**.
* **Unit Testing:** the inclusion of unit tests is mandatory. Tests validate that your code works as expected and makes it easier for future you or other developers to change the code with confidence.
* **GitHub Codespaces:** leverage GitHub Codespaces for prototyping
and initial development. Codespaces provide a complete,
configurable dev environment that allows you to code directly within
GitHub.
* **Command Line Interface (CLI):** implement a Command Line
Interface to allow users to interact with your project easily. This is
crucial as it offers a versatile way of running different functionalities
and options in your code.
