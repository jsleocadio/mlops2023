## Introduction

MLOps is communication between Data Scientists and the operations or production team. It is deeply collaborative in nature, designed to eliminate waste, automate as much as possible, and produce richer, more consistent insights with machine learning. Machine Learning can be a game changer for a business, but without some form of systematization, it can become just a scientific experiment.
